    <p class="text-center">During World War II, the mathematician Alan Turing joins a team of code-breakers at Britain top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park to try to decipher the code of the German Enigma machine. The problem is that Enigma is recorded every day. That means that even if the team can decipher a coded message, that code would be obsolete the next day. There are 159,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible codes that could be input into Enigma. While the rest of the team works on breaking the day-to-day codes because they believe it is the only way to learn the secret of Enigma, Alan works by himself on developing a machine, with a sort of artificial intelligence, which he believes will be able not only to break a daily code, but also to break any code immediately when it is input into Enigma. The problem, of course, is convincing his superiors to fund the building of the machine. The arrival of the only female member in the team, the brilliant Joan Clarke, provides Alan with a sense of how to manage a team. Alan and his team are able to crack the code, with the help of Alan's machine, by concentrating their search on repeated patterns used in weather forecasts by the Germans. <p>

    <h2 class="text-center"> ALAN TURING'S LIFE </h2>
    <br>
    <p class= "text-center"> <img src="https://www.designhub.it/cometa/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Alan-Turing.jpg" height="350" width="266" alt="errore" align="left">  Alan Mathison Turing, born on 23 June 1912 in London, was one of the founders of the study of computer logic, inventor of "artificial intelligence". He began his career as a mathematician at Kings College Cambridge in 1931.
      Only the great friendship with Christopher Morcom allowed him to start his university career: his friend unfortunately died of tuberculosis two years after their meeting. But the mark he had left in Turing was very profound and prompted him to continue his studies in mathematics, managing to develop his enormous potential. Later, at Princeton University, he began working on the so-called "Turing machine", which, in other words, represents a primitive "prototype" of the modern computer, obtained by giving the machine small instructions that it had to follow. During the Second World War, Turing helped the Ministry of Communications to decipher the codes used in German communications, a difficult task because the Germans had created a machine called the Enigma, which was capable of creating an ever-changing code: by decrypting it they could translate the messages sent by enemy generals to allies, to anticipate their attacks.
      During this time, Turing and his companions worked with a tool called "Colossus", which quickly and easily decoded the messages created by Enigma. Historians estimate that the breaking up of Enigma in less than two years saved more than 14 million lives, but it remained a government secret for 50 years.
      After the war Turing continued to work at the "National Physical Laboratory", trying to develop a machine capable of performing similar processes in the human brain. His life was very difficult due to his homosexuality. After a year of government-imposed hormone therapy he committed suicide on June 7, 1954. He was only 41 years old. Between 1885 and 1947 49,000 homosexuals were accused of indecency under the British government.
